# saya_hospitality_states #

 This package contains the code for SMACH staes for sayabot robot.

## Requirements ##

* __smach_ros__ package

The smach_ros package contains extensions for the SMACH library to integrate it tightly with ROS.
To know more click this [link](http://wiki.ros.org/smach_ros) 

Use following code to install:

    sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-smach-ros

* __actionlib__ package

The actionlib stack provides a standardized interface for interfacing with preemptable tasks

Use following code to install:

    sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-actionlib

* __smach_viewer__ package

The smach viewer is a GUI that shows the state of hierarchical SMACH state machines.
To know more click this [link](http://wiki.ros.org/smach_viewer) 

Use following code to install:

    sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-smach-viewer

To run use following code:

    rosrun smach_viewer smach_viewer.py 

__NOTE__: smach_viewer.py may not work in ROS Indigo. to make it work we need to make some change in __/opt/ros/indigo/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/xdot/xdot.py__ file.

Use following code to make a change in a file.

    $ cd /opt/ros/indigo/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/xdot/
    $ sudo gedit xdot.py

Now __xdot.py__ file will be opened in gedit editor.
Goto line number 480 and change the code as following:

    return int(self.read_code()) ----> return int(float(self.read_code())) 

After making changes close the file and again run the smach_viewer.py
Now smach_viewer.py will run properly.

## SMACH States ##

SMACH states are defined in the directory called states in src folder in this package.

path to directory:

    ~/sayatbot_ws/src/saya_hospitality_states/src/states

Example files:
__arm_maipulation_state.py__
__face_detection_state.py__
__speech_state.py__ 


After defining the states, they can be imported to SMACH container program that is in scripts directory.Steps to do that are given in Instruction file in this package.

## SMACH  Container Program ##

SMACH container program is the program that has the flow of control over the SMACH States. This program is saved in the scripts directory.

file name: __sayabot_test.py__ 

## Running SMACH ##

To start SMACH we should run the SMACH Container Program.

Use following code to run SMACH file:

    rosrun saya_hospitality_states roba.py

or use the launch file to run the SMACH node.

    roslaunch saya_hospitality_states sayabot_test_states.launch
